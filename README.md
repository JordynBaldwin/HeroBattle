# HeroBattle

This is an attempt to recreate and hopefully improve on an old text-based fantasy battle game. I initially started writing it in Python, but I eventually want to translate it into C# and use Unity to give it some graphics. It may eventually evolve into a full game with items, equipment, etc. especially since I started this project as a way to teach myself the skills I need for game developement, but I want to avoid feature creep so I might finish it and work on those skills in another project.
